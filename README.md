# 📦 Northwind Traders Sales Analysis (Team Project)

## 🔍 Overview
This project involved evaluating sales data for the fictional company **Northwind Traders** to identify underperforming products, generate business insights, and develop strategic recommendations.

As the **team lead**, I was responsible for organizing our workflow, setting deadlines, and ensuring consistent communication across our group. I also contributed directly to the sales analysis and co-authored a product performance RFP focused on underperforming product categories. Our work culminated in a formal presentation, which you can [watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgqg3GZ4gBc).
